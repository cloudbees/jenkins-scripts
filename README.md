# Groovy scripts for CloudBees CI

Note that many operations that used to be done via groovy scripts are nowadays better handled using [CloudBees Configuration as Code (CasC)](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-ci/latest/casc-oc/casc-landing-page).

The scripts in this repository can be run in the script console at: `Manage Jenkins > Script Console`.
Most work on any CloudBees CI instance, while some are specific to the operations center.
